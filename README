The R package builds on an interface to the C++ Morse-Smale complex computation as
first described in:

Gerber S, Bremer PT, Pascucci V, Whitaker R (2010). 
“Visual Exploration of High Dimensional Scalar Functions.” 
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 16(6), 1271–1280.


The main functionality is implemented in NNMSComplex.h and was implemented by S.
Gerber. The code uses the ANN library by David Mount and Sunil Arya distributed
under the LGPL license.  For detailed information on ANN see
http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN.



On this basic functionality the exploratory visualization approach in 

Gerber S, Bremer PT, Pascucci V, Whitaker R (2010). 
“Visual Exploration of High Dimensional Scalar Functions.” 
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 16(6), 1271–1280.

and the regression approach in

are implemented.
